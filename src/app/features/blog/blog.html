      <hr>
      <p>I am graduated with a degree in information technology from PTIT University. During my time
        at the univercity, I interned at Toshiba as a full-stack developer and at NCC focusing on Fron-
        tend using Angular. These interships gave me valuable hands-on experience with real-world
        development, helping me improve both technical skills and my professional mindset. After
        graduating, I joined FSS where I had a opportunity to help build the company’s core framework
        including a core Angular UI library based on Kendo UI and realtime notification module. In ad-
        dition I participated in an outsourcing project, where I worked with the cient’s core framework
        technologies such as micro frontend, frontend API, and Graphql. Right now I’m looking for op-
        portunities to grow futher both frontend, backend or devops skill and I’d really appreciate the
        chance to grow further at a company like yours</p>
